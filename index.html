    <h2>Other Hobbies and Interests</h2>

    <p>
        I have always been a avid player and watcher of sports. A characteristic I 
        still have. Despite dipping my toes in multiple sports, two of them hold a 
        special place in my heart, Cricket And Motor Racing.
    </p>

    <p>
        I family has been avid followers of cricket since i was very young. And I seemed
        to have picked the sport from that. The thing I love the best about the sport is 
        that despite the level and stakes of the competition, the love and respect for the 
        sport supercedes all the writter rules. It teaches me to build a very strong set of 
        core values to stick by in life.
    </p>

    <p>
        If I picked up on cricket through my family, the journey to the love of 
        motorsports has been anything but. I initially started watching the sport around 2011 for 
        a few races but mostly it did'nt catch my attention. But that changed in 2015 when my family 
        subscribed for the english newspaper towards the end of 2015. With the new international 
        perspective on the new also came a new international perspective on sports. Suddenly the 
        sport of which I had never heard in the previous 3 years became a regular visitor on my 
        doorsteps on monday mornings. After a few weeks of this regular occurance I switched on my 
        tv and watched the sport for the first time in many years and was instantly hooked. And my 
        love for the has only grown ten folds since then.
    </p>

    <p>
        Apart from the sports I also studied fine arts for a few months and got fairly good at it.
        But unfortunately a long time has passed since I used to draw just because I loved doing 
        it and now all my skills in this department are mostly diluted.
